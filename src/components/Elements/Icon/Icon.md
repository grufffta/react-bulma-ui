The icon element is a container for any type of icon font. Because the icons can take a few seconds to load, and because you want control over the space the icons will take, you can use the icon class as a reliable square container that will prevent the page to "jump" on page load.

Font Awesome is not loaded in styleguide so icon will not show.

```jsx
<Icon name='home' />
```
