```jsx 
<Content size='small'>
When you can't use the CSS classes you want, or when you just want to directly use HTML tags, use content as container. It can handle almost any HTML tag:
 paragraphs, lists, headings, blockquote quotes, em and strong, tables ect
This content class can be used in any context where you just want to (or can only) write some text. For example, it's used for the paragraph you're cu
currently reading.
</Content>
